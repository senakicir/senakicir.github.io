It's been a long time since I've felt this close to anyone. Religious upbringing, feeling inadequate as an older sibling, fear of sin, experiencing both guilt and joy over the feelings awakened by that first relationship. Craig Thompson, are you me?

Story time. When I was a kiddo, around 11 and my sister was 6, sometimes she'd get scared at night and ask to sleep with me. Sometimes I'd let her and she'd squeeze into my tiny bed. But sometimes, if I was feeling particularly grumpy that night, I'd tell her to go away. I keep seeing her standing there, me turning my back, and after a while, her padding back to her own bed. Isn't it the most awful, heartless thing?

I still feel bad about that and Craig Thompson gets me. 

Craig Thompson also gets that feeling of first love and first heartbreak. I swear, I felt every aspect of Craig and Raina's relationship. Feeling like a total outsider, meeting someone who finally understands you, never wanting to be apart, overflowing with <i>feelings</i> and those awful moments of heartbreak that cause actual physical pain, a pole being driven into your gut. Numbing yourself enough to put away everything that reminds them of you. I really felt all of that all over again as I was reading Blankets. That's powerful. 

And of course, religion, with all the comfort it brings and the stress it brings. Craig is always feeling guilty about how he sinned or is scared whether he sinned... And I felt horrible because that's so much pressure for anyone to put on themselves, let alone a kid. And that was me! That was me for such a major chunk of my life. How do I see this only now?

Blankets is overall an amazing trip down Craig Thompson's (or your own) memory lane. The artwork is gorgeous, the writing is sincere. For me it was extremely relatable, but I think everyone can find something in it for themselves.
